# 🍽 Savoring Success: Restaurant Sales Dashboard  

![Dashboard Screenshot](dashboard.png)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Every restaurant tells a story — through its menu, its customers, and its sales. This project explores the hidden patterns behind restaurant performance: which meals bring in the money, which cities love to dine, and which managers truly deliver results.  

The goal of this dashboard is to transform raw sales data into an engaging story — showing where the restaurant chain is winning, where it’s falling behind, and how it can savor even more success in the future.
